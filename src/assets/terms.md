## 15\. Acceptance

By signing the Scope of Work or otherwise agreeing to receive Services, the Client acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.

## 16\. Additional Terms for Supply Services (Where Applicable)

**Note**: This Section 16 applies only to Clients who choose to receive cleaning supplies or rented equipment from Dust Beaters (“Supplies Service”). If the Client does not opt in to the Supplies Service, this Section does not apply and Dust Beaters has no obligation to provide supplies.

1.  **Separate Quotes and Invoices**: Dust Beaters will provide a separate quote for the supply of cleaning products and/or rented equipment. A separate invoice will be generated on the 1st day of every month (or as otherwise stated in writing). Payment is due within 14 days, subject to the same late payment rules in Section 4 of these Terms and Conditions.
2.  **Pricing and Revisions**: The prices for supplies and rentals are independent from cleaning service fees and may change at any time at Dust Beaters’ sole discretion, without prior notice. If the Client does not agree to the updated pricing, the Client may terminate the Supplies Service as per Clause 8 of this Section.
3.  **Shipping Charges**: Any shipping or delivery fees will be billed to the Client as a separate line item. Unless otherwise stated, all shipping costs are due under the same payment terms as the supply invoice.
4.  **Delivery, Ownership, and Risk of Loss**
    *   **Delivery**: Dust Beaters will deliver supplies to the location agreed upon in writing. Delivery is deemed complete upon arrival at the Client’s premises or upon transfer to a common carrier.
    *   **Transfer of Ownership**: Title to the supplies passes to the Client only upon full payment of the relevant invoice(s).
    *   **Risk of Loss**: Once supplies are delivered, the Client assumes all risk of loss, theft, damage, or destruction, regardless of whether full payment has been made.
    *   **Rental Equipment**: Any rented equipment (e.g., dispensers) remains the property of Dust Beaters. The Client assumes responsibility for loss or damage of rented equipment while on Client premises.
5.  **Storage, Use Instructions, and No Warranty**
    *   **Storage & Use**: The Client is solely responsible for properly storing and using all supplies in accordance with any written instructions or labels. Dust Beaters is not liable for any damage, allergic reactions, or other harm resulting from misuse or improper storage.
    *   **Disclaimer of Warranties**: Dust Beaters provides no warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding the supplies or their fitness for any particular purpose.
6.  **Returns and Refunds**
    *   **Damaged Products**: If supplies are damaged upon delivery, the Client must notify Dust Beaters in writing ([support@dustbeaters.com](mailto:support@dustbeaters.com)) within 5 business days of receipt. Dust Beaters may, at its sole discretion, issue a refund, replacement, or credit if it determines the products were indeed damaged prior to or during delivery.
    *   **No Breach for Refunds**: Providing a refund or replacement beyond the specified timeline or conditions shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.
7.  **Bundle Discounts**
    *   **Combined Services**: If the Client receives discounted rates by bundling cleaning Services with Supplies Service, any cancellation or termination of either the cleaning Services or Supplies Service may result in the revocation of such discounts. Dust Beaters may charge the Client the standard, non-discounted rate for whichever service(s) remain.
8.  **Termination or Opt-Out of Supplies Service**
    *   **Partial Termination**: The Client may terminate only the Supplies Service by providing 14 days’ written notice. Termination of the Supplies Service does not terminate the entire cleaning Services Agreement.
    *   **Rented Equipment**: Within 30 days of terminating the Supplies Service, the Client must return any rented equipment to Dust Beaters or purchase it at a price determined by Dust Beaters. If the Client fails to return rented equipment within 30 days, the Client agrees to purchase it and will be invoiced accordingly.
    *   **Effect on Bundles**: Any bundle discount will no longer apply once the Supplies Service is terminated, and the Client’s cleaning Services fee will revert to the standard rate.

## 17\. Additional Scheduling Terms

### 17.1 Holiday Adjustments

*   **Services on Statutory Holidays**: Services will not be performed on statutory holidays.
*   **Rescheduling**: If a scheduled cleaning day falls on a statutory holiday, the service will be automatically rescheduled to the next business day unless an alternative arrangement is mutually agreed upon.

### 17.2 Flexibility for Additional Needs

*   **Additional Sessions**: The Client may request additional cleaning sessions for special occasions or high-traffic periods with a minimum of 48 hours’ notice, subject to availability and an extra charge.
*   **Schedule Adjustments**: Requests to adjust the schedule must be communicated at least 72 hours in advance to accommodate staffing and planning.
